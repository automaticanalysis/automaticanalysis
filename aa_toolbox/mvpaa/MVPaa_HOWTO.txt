To run an MVPaa analysis you need to follow a discrete number of steps:

1) MODELLING

Run an aamod_firstlevel_model (perhaps the aamod_firstlevel_model_MVPaa, 
if you wish to use the procedure used by Mumford JA, Turner BO, Ashby FG, 
Poldrack RA, 2011).

You will need to specify the relevant event names in the following fashion:

'conditionName_subN'

Where 'conditionName' is the name of your condition of interest, and 'N' is
a number defining the subdivision of the data within an imaging run.

e.g.
houses_sub1
faces_sub1
houses_sub2
faces_sub2

Events that do not have an "_subN" part will be considered nuisance events,
and ignored by MVPaa.

MVPaa will only consider pattern similarity between different "subdivisions"

2) CONTRAST (optional)

Optionally, if you wish to consider the T-values rather than the betas of
the conditions as the source of MPVaa pattern information, then run
contrasts on the betas of interest, using aamod_firstlevel_contrasts.

Using the t-values may improve your MVPaa performance slightly (CITATION
NEEDED!)

3) MVPaa (ROI based)

    A) ROIs

You should run your MVPaa analysis on unnormalised data.

To import a set of ROIs in (e.g. MNI) template space to the subject space, 
you will need to have preprocessing up to and including aamod_norm_noss,
which will give you the normalisation parameters of your structural.

These normalisation parameters can be used by aamod_unnormalise_rois to move
the ROIs into subject space and import them into the "rois" stream.
Simply add the comma delimitted location/filenames (within your ROI folder, i.e.
aap.directory_conventions.ROIdir) of your ROIs to the ROIlist field in the
aamod_unnormalise_rois.xml:

EXAMPLE:
=====
Assume your ROI dir, specified in aap.directory_conventions.ROIdir is:
/home/scientist/ROIs
Within this directory you have files:
/home/scientist/ROIs/V1.nii
/home/scientist/ROIs/V2.nii
/home/scientist/ROIs/Kanwisher/FFA.nii

Just set this in your aamod_unnormalise_rois:

<ROIlist>V1.nii,V2.nii,Kanwisher/FFA.nii</ROIlist>
=====

    B) Modules needed in recipe

You will need to add several modules to your recipe:

aamod_MVPaa_roi_1st (for 1st level analysis)
aamod_MVPaa_roi_2nd (for 2nd level, across subject analysis)

    C) MVPaa preditions/hypotheses/contrasts

You will need to add some MVPaa contrasts to your user script.
The best way to think of an MVPaa contrast is as of a univariate contrast
but in 2-D. This contrast will have a hypothesis comparing the similarity
within and across your conditions.

EXAMPLE:
=====
Assume you want to distinguish faces from houses, you would expect a high
similarity for house-house and face-face, but a low for face-house.
A matrix of our conditions would look like this:

        face    house
face    1       -1
house   -1      1

We can input a contrast into MVPaa by including something like this in the
user script:

aap = mvpaa_addcontrast(aap, ... % aap structure
'aamod_MVPaa_roi_1st_00001', ... % MVPaa module
'*', ... % Subject name to which we add contrast ('*' for all subjects)
'FvsH', ... % Name of contrast
[1 -1; -1 1]); % Matrix for contrast
=====

The absolute values in the matrix are of no consequence, just the relative
values between conditions and the sign of the difference.
Thus, [1 -1; -1 1] is exactly equivalent to [-pi -12; -12 -pi]

Also, you can use the help function mvpaa_label2cont to transform a set of 
discrete or continuous labels into a hypothesis matrix:

EXAMPLE:
=====
MVPaa_con = mvpaa_label2cont([1 2 4], 0) % discrete labels
% [1 -1 -1; -1 1 -1; -1 -1 1]

MVPaa_con = mvpaa_label2cont([1 2 5], 0) % continuous labels
% [2 1 -2; 1 2 -1; -2 -1 2]

=====

4) MVPaa (Brain searchlight based)

    A) Modules needed in recipe
    
You will need to add several modules to your recipe:

aamod_MVPaa_brain_1st (for 1st level analysis)
aamod_MVPaa_brain_SPM (converts 1st level analysis to images, normalises and smoothes)
aamod_secondlevel_model (for 2nd level, across subject analysis)

    B) MVPaa preditions/hypotheses/contrasts

[SEE ABOVE]

EXAMPLE
=====
aap = mvpaa_addcontrast(aap, ... % aap structure
'aamod_MVPaa_brain_1st_00001', ... % MVPaa module
'*', ... % Subject name to which we add contrast ('*' for all subjects)
'FvsH', ... % Name of contrast
[1 -1; -1 1]); % Matrix for contrast
