function cr = MatCorr(S1,S2);
%%% Get the pairwise correlations between two N by M data matrices.
%%%
%%% Inputs:
%%% S1 = a N observations x M Measurement data matrix
%%% S2 =  matrix of the same size as S1
%%%
%%% Outputs:
%%% cr = an N x 1 vector of the corelations between the paired columns M of
%%% S1 and S2.
