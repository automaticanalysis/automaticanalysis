function Y = QuickSVD(y)
%%% Perform a Singular Value decomposition and return the first eigen
%%% vector.  This can be used as an alternative to mean(X,2);
%%%
%%% Input:
%%% y = input matrix
%%%
%%% Output:
%%% Y = output vector which is the first eigenvector computed on input
%%% matrix y;
