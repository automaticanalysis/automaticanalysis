function ndx = sub2ind_aps(siz,loc)
%==============================================================================
%%% This is a rewrite of the built-in matlab function that reworks how
%%% inputs are specified. Point locations are specified as a matrix rather
%%% than as a series of vectors. Comes in very handy if you don't know 
%%% matrix sizes in advance. Try "help sub2ind" for more details.
%%%
%%% Inputs:
%%% siz = matrix size (e.g. size(M))
%%%
%%% loc = a matrix of point locations (same width as number as length of
%%%     siz).
%%%
%%% Output:
%%% ndx = vector indcies for specified matrix subindices.
