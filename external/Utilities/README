All scripts in the folder fall under the GNU public license.  A copy of the license has been included.

I don't do a good job of commenting all of my scripts, but I'm working on a webpage to at least provide the overview of how to use these scripts.

The website is still a work in progress, and can be found at:
http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~aschultz/Web/Aarons_Scripts/Aarons_Scripts.html

You can also reach by email with questions, comments, feature requests, and bug reports at aschultz@martinos.org.

This work was supported in parts by the Harvard Aging Brain Study ( NIH-P01AG036694), NIH-R01-AG027435, and the Mass. General Hospital Corp.

I hope you enjoy the scripts and find the, useful!
