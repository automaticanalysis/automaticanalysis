%
% This toolbox is an extension of the "New Segment Toolbox" in SPM8, but 
% uses a completely different segmentation approach.  
% 
% 1. The segmentation approach is based on an adaptive Maximum A Posterior 
% (MAP) technique without the need for a priori information about tissue 
% probabilities. That is, the Tissue Probability Maps are not used constantly 
% in the sense of the classical unified segmentation approach, but just for 
% spatial normalization3. The following MAP estimation is adaptive in the 
% sense that local variations of the parameters (i.e., means and variance) 
% are modelled as slowly varying spatial functions (Rajapakse et al. 1997). 
% This not only accounts for intensity inhomogeneities but also for other 
% local variations of intensity. 
%
% 2. Additionally, the segmentation approach uses a Partial Volume Estimation 
% (PVE) with a simplified mixed model of at most two tissue types 
% (Tohka et al. 2004). We start with an initial segmentation into three pure 
% classes: gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
% based on the above described MAP estimation. The initial segmentation is 
% followed by a PVE of two additional mixed classes: GM-WM and GM-CSF. This 
% results in an estimation of the amount (or fraction) of each pure tissue 
% type present in every voxel (as single voxels - given by their size - 
% probably contain more than one tissue type) and thus provides a more 
% accurate segmentation.
%
% 3. Furthermore, we apply two denoising methods. The first method is an 
% optimized block-wise non-local means (NLM) denoising filter 
% (Coupe et al. 2008). This filter will remove noise while preserving edges 
% and is implemented as preprocessing step. The second method is a classical 
% Markov Random Field (MRF) approach, which incorporates spatial prior 
% information of adjacent voxels into the segmentation estimation 
% (Rajapakse et al. 1997).
%
% 4. Another important extension to the SPM8 segmentation is the integration 
% of the Dartel normalisation (Ashburner 2007) into the toolbox. If 
% high-dimensional spatial normalisation is chosen, an already existing Dartel 
% template in MNI space will be used. This template was derived from 550 
% healthy control subjects of the IXI-database (http://www.brain-development.org) 
% and is provided in MNI space  for six different iteration steps of Dartel 
% normalisation. Thus, for the majority of studies the creation of 
% sample-specific Dartel templates is not necessary anymore.
